## TODOS

## Signin/Signup Pages

1. Error message display (notifiactions for when user has an incorrect password, didn't input something into a field, etc) Current error messages are only popups on mobile.

## Expenses Page:

1. Dropdowns for each category? Maybe clicking a button to bring you to a list of all the expenses for that type.
2. Deleting an expense is currently bugged.
3. UI changes?

## Income Page

1. Similar to expenses page - maybe include similar UI for viewing a list of the different income sources.

## Budget Page

1. Mostly incomplete, maybe let the add logic to add your total budget automatically while you input individual budgets for each section instead of manually deciding the budget total.

## Other

1. Maybe another page with some data or graphs or something to show your expenses vs income month by month? Probably not necessary but would be nice.
2. .env file for more secure firebase information storage
